- dog -

(c) Mark McDonald, 2006

As the text in the script says, it's a simple colour replacement for the unix 'cat'
utility.  There is already another project called dog, so this may get renamed in
the future some time - any suggestions are welcome.

Currently I'm just releasing this as freeware, with no license to modify or
redistribute.  I intend to give it a GPL job later, when it gets a new name.

enjoi.
